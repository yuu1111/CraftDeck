   cd craftdeck-mod
   ./gradlew build

   # For Stream Deck plugin development
   cd craftdeck-plugin
   dotnet build
   ```

#### Code Style Guidelines

**Minecraft Mod (Kotlin)**
- Follow [Kotlin Coding Conventions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coding-conventions.html)
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add KDoc comments for public APIs

**Stream Deck Plugin (C#)**

- Examples:
  ```
  feat(mod): add inventory data collection
  fix(plugin): resolve connection timeout issue
  docs(readme): update installation instructions
  ```

#### Pull Request Process

1. **Create a feature branch** from `main`:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following the code style guidelines

3. **Test thoroughly**:
   - Minecraft mod: Test with multiple mod loaders
   - Stream Deck plugin: Test with different Stream Deck models
   - Verify WebSocket communication works correctly

4. **Update documentation** if needed

5. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear title and description
   - Reference related issues
   - List of changes made
   - Screenshots/videos if applicable

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Guidelines

### Minecraft Mod Architecture

- **Common Module**: Shared logic across all mod loaders
- **Platform Modules**: Mod loader-specific implementations
- **WebSocket Server**: Handles all client connections
- **Data Collection**: Gathers game state information
- **Command Execution**: Processes incoming commands

### Stream Deck Plugin Architecture

- **Main Action**: Primary plugin action handler
- **WebSocket Client**: Manages server connections
- **Property Inspector**: Configuration UI
- **Data Display**: Formats and displays game information
- **Command Sending**: Formats and sends commands to mod

### Communication Protocol

- **JSON-based**: All messages use JSON format
- **Type-based**: Each message has a `type` field for routing
- **Bidirectional**: Both mod and plugin can initiate communication
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of connection issues

## üß™ Testing

### Minecraft Mod Testing

```bash
# Run Fabric development client
./gradlew :fabric:runClient

# Run Forge development client
./gradlew :forge:runClient

# Run Quilt development client
./gradlew :quilt:runClient
```

### Stream Deck Plugin Testing

```bash
# Build and deploy to Stream Deck
dotnet build

# Manual testing steps:
# 1. Install built plugin in Stream Deck software
# 2. Add CraftDeck action to Stream Deck
# 3. Start Minecraft with mod
# 4. Verify communication and data display
```

### Integration Testing

1. Start Minecraft with CraftDeck mod
2. Verify WebSocket server starts on port 8080
3. Install and configure Stream Deck plugin
4. Test data flow: mod ‚Üí plugin
5. Test command execution: plugin ‚Üí mod
6. Test error handling and reconnection
